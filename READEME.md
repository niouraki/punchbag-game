# Vue.js Punchbag game
This game follows the tutorial Vue.js 2 Tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjfpQlVem-8)

It isn't created using Vue CLI but just using the Vue instance.

## My functionalities
I added two functionalities of my own to this game.
1. The color of the health bar. First it is green and when health reaches 50% it turns red.
2. The sound. Every time the bag is punched there is a punching sound.
